# Python_Project8--Star-Wars-Survey
Analyzing data on the Star Wars movies. 

While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?

The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses, which you download from their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).

For this project, you'll be cleaning and exploring the data set called __'star_wars.csv'__.

The data has several columns, including:

- __RespondentID__ - An anonymized ID for the respondent (person taking the survey)
- __Gender__ - The respondent's gender
- __Age__ - The respondent's age
- __Household Income__ - The respondent's income
- __Education__ - The respondent's education level
- __Location (Census Region)__ - The respondent's location
- __Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise?__ - Has a Yes or No response
- __Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise?__ - Has a __Yes__ or __No__ response

There are several other columns containing answers to questions about the Star Wars movies. For some questions, the respondent had to check one or more boxes. This type of data is difficult to represent in columnar format. As a result, this data set needs a lot of cleaning.

#### Step 1
- Reading the data into a pandas dataframe.
- Review the column names with star_wars.columns.

#### Step 2
First, you'll need to remove the invalid rows. For example, RespondentID is supposed to be a unique ID for each respondent, but it's blank in some rows. You'll need to remove any rows with an invalid RespondentID.

#### Step 3
Now looking at the next two columns, which are:

- Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise?
- Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise?

Both represent __Yes/No__ questions. They can also be __NaN__ where a respondent chooses not to answer a question. We can use the pandas.Series.value_counts() method on a series to see all of the unique values in a column, along with the total number of times each value appears.alue_counts() method on a series to see all of the unique values in a column, along with the total number of times each value appears.

#### Step 5
Both columns are currently string types, because the main values they contain are __Yes__ and __No__. We can make the data a bit easier to analyze down the road by converting each column to a Boolean having only the values __True__, __False__, and __NaN__. Booleans are easier to work with because we can select the rows that are __True__ or __False__ without having to do a string comparison.

We used the __pandas.Series.map()__ method on series objects to perform the conversion.
series will end up looking like this:
- __[True, False, NaN, True]__

#### Step 6
The next six columns represent a single checkbox question. The respondent checked off a series of boxes in response to the question, __Which of the following Star Wars films have you seen? Please select all that apply__.

The columns for this question are:

- Which of the following Star Wars films have you seen? Please select all that apply. - Whether or not the respondent saw Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace.
- Unnamed: 4 - Whether or not the respondent saw Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones.
- Unnamed: 5 - Whether or not the respondent saw Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith.
- Unnamed: 6 - Whether or not the respondent saw Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.
- Unnamed: 7 - Whether or not the respondent saw Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back.
- Unnamed: 8 - Whether or not the respondent saw Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi.

For each of these columns, if the value in a cell is the name of the movie, that means the respondent saw the movie. If the value is NaN, the respondent either didn't answer or didn't see the movie. We'll assume that they didn't see the movie.

We are converting each of these columns to a Boolean, then rename the column something more intuitive. We can convert the values the same way we did earlier, except that we'll need to include the movie title and __NaN__ in the mapping dictionary.

#### step 7
After calling the __map()__ method on a series, the column should only contain the values __True__ and __False_-.

Next, we'll need to rename the columns to better reflect what they represent. We can use the __pandas.DataFrame.rename()__ method on dataframes to accomplish this.

The __df.rename()__ method works a lot like __map()__. We pass it a dictionary that maps the current column names to new ones.

This method will only rename the columns we specify in the dictionary, and won't change the names of other columns. The code above will rename the unnamed columns. 

#### Step 8
The next six columns ask the respondent to rank the Star Wars movies in order of least favorite to most favorite. __1__ means the film was the most favorite, and __6__ means it was the least favorite. Each of the following columns can contain the value __1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or NaN__:

- Please rank the Star Wars films in order of preference with 1 being your favorite film in the franchise and 6 being your least favorite film. - How much the respondent liked Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace
- Unnamed: 10 - How much the respondent liked Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones
- Unnamed: 11 - How much the respondent liked Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith
- Unnamed: 12 - How much the respondent liked Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope
- Unnamed: 13 - How much the respondent liked Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back
- Unnamed: 14 - How much the respondent liked Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi

Fortunately, these columns don't require a lot of cleanup. We are converting each column to a numeric type, though, then renaming the columns so that we can tell what they represent more easily.

We can do the numeric conversion with the pandas.DataFrame.astype() method on dataframes.

#### Step 9
Now that we've cleaned up the ranking columns, we can find the highest-ranked movie more quickly. To do this, take the mean of each of the ranking columns using the pandas.DataFrame.mean() method on dataframes.

#### Step 10
Making a bar chart of each ranking by importing matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

#### Step 11
__Rankings__:
So far, we've cleaned up the data, renamed several columns, and computed the average ranking of each movie. As I suspected, it looks like the "original" movies are rated much more highly than the newer ones.

That means we can figure out how many people have seen each movie just by taking the sum of the column (even though they contain Boolean values) by computing the sum of each of the seen columns. Then making a bar chart of each seen columns.

#### Step 12
### View counts
It appears that the original movies were seen by more respondents than the newer movies. This reinforces what we saw in the rankings, where the earlier movies seem to be more popular.

We know which movies the survey population as a whole has ranked the highest. Now let's examine how certain segments of the survey population responded. There are several columns that segment our data into two groups. Here are a few examples:

- Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise? - __True__ or __False__
- Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Trek franchise? - __Yes__ or __No__
- Gender - __Male__ or __Female__

We can split a dataframe into two groups based on a binary column by creating two subsets of that column.The subsets will allow us to compute the most viewed movie, the highest-ranked movie, and other statistics separately for each group.

#### Step 13
- Now plot seperatly for each group from ranking columns.
- Plot seperatly for each group from seen columns.

### Male/Female differences in favorite Star Wars movie and most seen movie
Interestingly, more males watches episodes 1-3, but males liked them far less than females did.

#### Here are some potential next steps:

- Try to segment the data based on columns like __Education, Location (Census Region), and Which character shot first?__, which aren't binary. Are they any interesting patterns?
- Clean up columns __15__ to __29__, which contain data on the characters respondents view favorably and unfavorably.
    - Which character do respondents like the most?
    - Which character do respondents dislike the most?
    - Which character is the most controversial (split between likes and dislikes)?
